# Introduction

Welcome to **Socktainer** 🚢 - a CLI/daemon that brings Docker compatibility to Apple's containerization framework on macOS!

## What is Socktainer?

Socktainer exposes a Docker-compatible REST API on top of Apple's containerization libraries, allowing you to use familiar Docker tools and clients to manage containers on your Apple Silicon Mac. It seamlessly bridges the gap between the Docker ecosystem and Apple's container framework.

By creating a Unix domain socket at `$HOME/.socktainer/container.sock`, Socktainer enables common Docker clients (like the Docker CLI) to interact with local containers on macOS using the standard Docker API surface 🐳💻.
